<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hospital Linen Supply Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rental</li><li>Customer Owned Goods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hospital linen supply market is primarily divided into two types: rental and customer-owned goods (COG). Rental involves hospitals sourcing linens from specialized suppliers who manage inventory, laundering, and delivery. This option allows for flexibility and reduced operational burdens. In contrast, the COG market entails hospitals purchasing their linens, managing the laundering in-house or outsourcing it.
