<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pap Smear Test</li><li>HPV DNA Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HPV testing market primarily comprises two types: Pap smear tests and HPV DNA tests. The Pap smear test, or cervical cytology, screens for abnormal cell changes in the cervix, indicating potential precursors to cervical cancer. In contrast, HPV DNA tests specifically detect the presence of high-risk HPV strains responsible for cervical cancer, providing a more direct evaluation of infection. Both testing modalities are essential for early detection and management of HPV-related diseases, influencing clinical decisions and patient outcomes.</p></p>
