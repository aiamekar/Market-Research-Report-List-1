<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food And Beverage Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contact-Less</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Food and Beverage Level Sensor market comprises two main types: contact and contactless sensors. Contact sensors directly touch the liquid, utilizing mechanisms like float switches or capacitive sensing to measure levels. They are often used in applications where precision and reliability are critical. In contrast, contactless sensors employ technologies such as ultrasonic or radar to gauge liquid levels without direct contact, making them ideal for sanitary applications where contamination risks must be minimized. Both types cater to diverse industry needs.</p></p>
