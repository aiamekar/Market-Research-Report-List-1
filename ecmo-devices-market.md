<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ECMO Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ECMO devices, or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation systems, are classified into two primary types: VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO and VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO. VA ECMO is used for patients with both cardiac and respiratory failure, providing support by oxygenating blood and assisting heart function. In contrast, VV ECMO is designed primarily for respiratory support, oxygenating blood while allowing the heart to function independently. Both types play a critical role in critical care, enhancing survival rates in severe respiratory and cardiac conditions.</p></p>
